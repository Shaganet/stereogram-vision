# stereogram-vision

## Repository goal

The purpose of this repository is to create a dataset of stereograms and train a neural network to recognize hidden images using computer vision techniques.

## Project Stages: 

- **Dataset Collection** — gather stereograms with hidden images and a control group without hidden content.
- **Data Annotation** — label each image as 1 (has hidden image) or 0 (no hidden image).
- **Model Training** — train a neural network  to classify.
- **Real-World Testing** — validate the model on unseen, real stereograms from public or user sources.
